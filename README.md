## Abstract
Rock paper scissors?
We can have 2 qubits, and they have the Hadamard gate applied to them. There are 4 equally possible probabilitiesâ€”000, 001, 011, and 010. We then tell the qubits to make a measurement, corresponding with scissors (000), paper (001), and rock (010). If one of the gates is not chosen, then it measures the values of the quibits until it does. The loop repeats unless one of the numbers is chosen. We implement counters for both the classical computer and quantum computer. When either wins, its count gets incremented. The game of rock paper scissors gets repeated for a very large number of times (as the Law of Large Numbers would suggest doing) to see if one of them has the advantage.  Quantum measurements are random and probablistic, while computers have algorithms, and the more random then its less likely to lose.  

## Introduction
this will be our introduction

## Our Motivation and Goals
A great deal of our motivation to create this project arose from 1) a fundamental principle taught in The Coding School's QxQ course (sponsored by IBM Quantum) that quantum measurement is inherently probabilistic. Naturally we saw that applying this idea to a fundamental game such as Rock Paper Scissors would be the best way to put this idea to the test and see it in practical usage. The course's initial emphasis on quantum computing vs. classical computing also inspired us to put both quantum and classical implementations of the game head-to-head where we compare the results of classic computer algorithms for random number generation (0 = rock, 1 = paper, 2 = scissors) versus the intrinsic randomness of various quantum algorithm outcomes.


## Project Elements and Usage
The project contains both a regular Python RPS program and a quantum gate-based RPS program. Both can be standalone, but for the purposes of this project, we ran them against each other multiple times to draw conclusions about the different natures of the two.

## Demonstration

Check out some info in the [event's repository](https://github.com/iQuHACK/2021) to get started.

Having a README in your team's repository facilitates judging. A good README contains:
* a clear title for your project,
* a short abstract,
* the motivation/goals for your project,
* a description of the work you did, and
* proposals for future work.

You can find a potential README template in [one of last year's projects](https://github.com/iQuHACK/QuhacMan).

Feel free to contact the staff with questions over our [event's slack](https://iquhack.slack.com), or via iquhack@mit.edu.

Good luck!
