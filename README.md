## Abstract
Rock paper scissors? 
We can have 2 quibits, and they have the Hadimard gate applied to them.   There are 4 equally possible probabilities,  000, 001, 011, and 010.    We then tell the quibits to make a measurement, corresponding with scissors(000), paper(001), and rock(010).  If one of the gates is not chosen, then it measures the values of the quibits until it does.   The loop repeats unless one of the numbers is chosen.  There is a quantum counter, an there is a classical counter, and when either win their count gets incremented. The game of rock paper scissors gets repeated for a very large number of times, to see if one of them has the advantage.  Quantum measurements are ranom, while computers have algorythms, and the more random then its less likely to lose.

Check out some info in the [event's repository](https://github.com/iQuHACK/2021) to get started.

Having a README in your team's repository facilitates judging. A good README contains:
* a clear title for your project,
* a short abstract,
* the motivation/goals for your project,
* a description of the work you did, and
* proposals for future work.

You can find a potential README template in [one of last year's projects](https://github.com/iQuHACK/QuhacMan).

Feel free to contact the staff with questions over our [event's slack](https://iquhack.slack.com), or via iquhack@mit.edu.

Good luck!
